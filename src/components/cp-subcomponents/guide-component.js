                    Programming is fun, programming is an exercise for your brain, programming is a mental sport 
                    and when this sport is held over the internet involving sport programmer as a contestant then 
                    it is called Competitive Programming. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Programming is a challenging role and once you enter this field you will encounter new 
                    challenges and you may have to solve some problems which no one has solved before or their 
                    solution doesn’t exist anywhere. At that time you are expected to come up with a solution in 
                    the least possible time using your problem-solving and logical ability. So the one and clear 
                    goal behind these competitive programming is “To prepare a programmer such that his/her logical 
                    ability increases and he/she is able to write code for the challenging situation.”

                    <p>
                    Another reason is that a lot of big companies like Google, Facebook. Microsoft, Amazon hires 
                    through competitive programming so if you want to get into these companies then you really 
                    need to get your hands dirty in competitive programming.

                    1.	Improves Logic: Programming logic improves by practice. You are smart from very beginning. 
                    With competitive programming you continuously train yourself with algorithmic problems that test 
                    the better out of your current logic skills. By practicing more and more your get better and 
                    improves your programming logic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    2.	Makes you more focused and faster: Thinking about a problem and finding its solution make you 
                    more focused. With an improved logic, you will be able to think faster, solve problems faster, 
                    decide faster and put your thinking and solutions into code faster without going to and fro thinking 
                    which approach to use for your code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    3.	Helps you solve complicated problems: In programming contests after easy tasks you will solve 
                    complex tasks which are not for ordinary programmers. By doing CP you will learn how to solve these 
                    out of ordinary tasks. This will help prepare you for a job because you can adopt and solve various kind 
                    of problems in various type of situations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    4.	Teaches you how to work in teams: Working in a team is very important skill in every field while in software
                     development it is more important because most jobs will require you at some point to work in a team. CP helps
                      you learn how to effectively work together, as you must work with others on your team to complete the same task. 
                      In this situation you will learn how to assess your team member’s strength and weakness and effectively divide 
                      responsibilities between each other. Additionally, in every company, each team have a leader. If you are in 
                      management role within a team, then knowing how to organize and motivate your team members is a key.

                    <p>
                    5.	Make you desirable candidate for major companies: Participating in CP contests make you a desirable 
                    candidate for big companies. In CP organizer websites and companies, these big companies always have a look 
                    and they pick the candidates with high potential.
