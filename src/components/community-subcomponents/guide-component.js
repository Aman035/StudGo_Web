                    A Community Forum is an online “meeting place” that is used to engage with others to debate, 
                    share knowledge and communicate with others about a wide range of topics participants are interested in discussing.
                    As it relates to customer experience, a Community Forum is a type of self-service support where 
                    customers can find a resolution to their problems without having to contact a customer service agent. 
                    As the saying goes, the best number of contacts is zero. Customers want to solve questions themselves.

                    An online community forum is an online space created by an organization or a brand, where members, 
                    customers and fans alike can congregate, ask questions, receive peer-to-peer support, discuss 
                    interests surrounding the brand and make social connections.

                    Online communities and forums provide learners with a platform to share their thoughts, have healthy 
                    discussions, get feedback, clarify their questions, and learn new, industry-relevant information. It 
                    provides an avenue for like-minded people to connect and share knowledge.

                    First of all, let’s understand the difference between online communities and forums. Online communities 
                    are platforms where questions will be asked, and members can answer. Forums are more like discussion 
                    groups where people speak their opinions and share information. The thread of questions and answers, 
                    and discussions will be visible for anyone to see. Sometimes, they will be visible only to members. 
                    A majority of these online communities and forums are free to use. Anyone can create an account, ask 
                    and answer questions, and participate in discussions.

                    There are a huge number of communities and forums present. It is important to choose the right 
                    one according to your needs. Before choosing the right place, decide on the purpose and be specific. 
                    For example, ‘I want to know more about creating authority using backlinks from case studies’. Having 
                    a clear vision of your goal will help you shortlist the communities and forums.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    After having a clear and specific purpose, check the most frequently used online communities and forums 
                    in your particular niche. If you have some demographic-specific needs, be sure to shortlist them. Now 
                    you will have a condensed list of online communities and forums
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    According to the 90-9-1 rule, 90 percent of users are lurkers, 9 percent are occasional contributors 
                    and 1 percent are heavy contributors. So, check the number of active participants in your niche. 
                    It’s of no use to join a popular platform and later realize that there are no contributors to your niche.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Now, most of the communities will have an option to see specific topics based on tags. Use this option 
                    to see the quality of the questions and answers in your specific field. If it is satisfactory and 
                    already making you interested in reading more, then select the particular community. If the questions 
                    and answers aren’t up to the mark, do not waste your time. You can do the same for forums, too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In the end, you will have a list of four to five online communities and forums. Create an account, 
                    understand how it works and start utilizing it for your purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As you start using, you will find two or three online communities and forums that you prefer more 
                    than the rest. Ditch the others and start concentrating on these selected ones, going back to the 
                    others only when you feel the need to learn more.
                    If you are enrolling in an eLearning course, see if it has any communities or forums. 
                    You can become a part of it and gain wider insights from your fellow learners when you are taking up the course.

                    A forum is one of those places that can serve as a springboard to growing a 
                    loyal community. Social networks have their place, but if you have ever used Facebook 
                    or LinkedIn Groups — and to a lesser degree Google+, it’s easy to see the limitations. 
                    While social networks can be a great place to share information, there really isn’t as 
                    much room for serious discussions
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Forums offer an easy way to collaborate and discuss anything and everything. Any user can 
                    start a discussion on the topic of their choice (within the guidelines of that particular forum) 
                    and gather ideas and insight from others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The type of dialogue that occurs in forums is usually highly specific. Usually, when someone 
                    asks for advice in a forum it is because the answer is not easily found online. 
                    This can lead to highly targeted search traffic. It also can make your forum rank in Google
                     for these long-tail searches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Think about how much concentrated knowledge and information an active forum has. I’m sure you 
                    can see the big picture. When you have participants sharing their knowledge, over time you are 
                    able to build a very respectable resource for people interested in your niche. Any good resource 
                    keeps people coming back, plain and simple.

                        StackOverflow is an absolute must as a programmer community for anyone who is serious about web development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Since its founding in 2008, it’s been the go-to sites for over 4.7 million developers. 
                        It is without a doubt one of the best places to find an answer to pretty much any coding question.
                        The site has a carrot and stick approach that works well. They reward users who 
                        answer questions often and do so thoughtfully. StackOverflow also helps ensure 
                        this by suspending users who demonstrate any unhelpful behaviour. You can rest 
                        assured that you are receiving top notch advice anytime you are looking for help.
                        The only drawback to this programming community is that there is so much going on, 
                        it can be daunting for the novice coder. Take your time, spend a little while lurking 
                        and reading and then jump in when you’re ready. The community is a friendly bunch.

                        Quora is a top-ranked question and answering community that can form the basis of a successful
                        marketing campaign. This is how to do it.
                        Quora is not only a highly ranked question and answer community, it’s one of the top 
                        online destinations in the world.
                        This makes it a great place to begin the process of making a site popular and improving rankings and traffic.

                    Reddit is a community-determined aggregator of content.
                    It is a social platform where users submit posts that other users ‘upvote’ or 
                    ‘downvote’ based on if they like it. If a post gets lots of upvotes it moves up the 
                    Reddit rankings so that more people can see it. If it gets downvotes it quickly falls 
                    and disappears from most people’s view.

                    Reddit is split out into sub-communities, or subreddits. They can be created by 
                    any user around any subject, whether it’s something broad like technology, or as 
                    specific as a single joke. Each subreddit feeds into the full Reddit list of submissions 
                    meaning a post in any subreddit (unless it’s private) could reach the front page of the website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    While you post on each subreddit in the same way, many have different sets of rules. Be sure to 
                    read these before posting somewhere. Reddit is notoriously strict on things like this to keep 
                    subreddits on topic and to stop spammers.

                    Kaggle, a subsidiary of Google LLC, is an online community of data scientists and machine learning 
                    practitioners. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a 
                    web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, 
                    and enter competitions to solve data science challenges   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Kaggle got its start in 2010 by offering machine learning competitions and now also offers 
                    a public data platform, a cloud-based workbench for data science, and Artificial Intelligence 
                    education. Its key personnel were Anthony Goldbloom and Jeremy Howard. Nicholas Gruen was 
                    founding chair succeeded by Max Levchin. Equity was raised in 2011 valuing the company at 
                    $25 million. On 8 March 2017, Google announced that they were acquiring Kaggle.
