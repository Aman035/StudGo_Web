                     and modified according to the requirement of the user. Open source software is that by which 
                     the source code or the base code is usually available for modification or enhancement by 
                     anyone for reusability and accessibility. Open source code is the part of software that mostly
                      users don't ever see. Anyone can manipulate and change a piece of software so that the program 
                      or application can work. Programmers who have access to a computer program source code can improve 
                      a program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.

                    Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
                    "Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code 
                    computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or 
                    "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve 
                    that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.

                    <p>
                    <b>Control</b> : Many people prefer open source software because they have more control over that kind
                     of software. They can examine the code to make sure it's not doing anything they don't want 
                     it to do, and they can change parts of it they don't like. Users who aren't programmers also 
                     benefit from open source software, because they can use this software for any purpose they wish—not 
                     merely the way someone else thinks they should.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>Training</b> : Other people like open source software because it helps them become better programmers. Because 
                    open source code is publicly accessible, students can easily study it as they learn to make better software. 
                    Students can also share their work with others, inviting comment and critique, as they develop their skills. 
                    When people discover mistakes in programs' source code, they can share those mistakes with others to help 
                    them avoid making those same mistakes themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>Security</b> : Some people prefer open source software because they consider it more secure and stable than proprietary 
                    software. Because anyone can view and modify open source software, someone might spot and correct errors or omissions 
                    that a program's original authors might have missed. And because so many programmers can work on a piece of open source 
                    software without asking for permission from original authors, they can fix, update, and upgrade open source software more 
                    quickly than they can proprietary software.                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>Stability</b> : Many users prefer open source software to proprietary software for important, long-term projects. 
                    Because programmers publicly distribute the source code for open source software, users relying on that software 
                    for critical tasks can be sure their tools won't disappear or fall into disrepair if their original creators stop 
                    working on them. Additionally, open source software tends to both incorporate and operate according to open standards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>Community</b> : Open source software often inspires a community of users and developers to form around it. That's not 
                    unique to open source; many popular applications are the subject of meetups and user groups. But in the case of open 
                    source, the community isn't just a fanbase that buys in (emotionally or financially) to an elite user group; it's the 
                    people who produce, test, use, promote, and ultimately affect the software they love.

                        There are a lot of reasons why people contribute to an open source. You can improve your existing skills through 
                        the practice working on a project, meet likeminded people, be a teacher for others or find a mentor for yourself, 
                        build public artefacts which might draw attention to you and your work helping grow a reputation or even make a 
                        career, learn people skills whether it’s leadership or managing conflicts, organizing others, and after all it’s 
                        empowering to make changes no matter how big or small.

                        Before any further action, always check whether the idea you want to submit hasn’t been raised and discussed already. 
                        After doing that you may start to communicate. On GitHub it’s possible by opening an issue or pull request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When you’re opening an issue it’s the same as starting a conversation or a discussion. 
                    Pull request is for starting to work on a solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    To raise an issue you might want to brows the issues that other people have already raised. 
                    This can give you the understanding of how things done. After that, click the ‘New Issue’ button. 
                    Make sure you include as much information as possible. You can mention your hardware and software 
                    setup and provide screenshots or recordings that illustrate the issue or an error. Also you can 
                    propose a new feature or other project idea. Include as much detail as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    To make a pull request you don’t necessary have to submit a finished work. Opening it early on 
                    others can watch or give feedback on your progress. It’s completely okay to mark it as a Work 
                    in Progress (WIP) in the subject line. There’s always the opportunity to add more commits later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If you’d like to contribute code, you should clone the original project, make changes to your copy, 
                    and then ask the project’s owner if they want to pull your changes into their original repository
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In GitHub there’s a process for opening a pull request. First of all, you need to fork the repository. 
                    By running the git clone command from your terminal create a local clone of your fork. Then connect to 
                    the original repository. Using the git “Remote Add Upstream” command you need to tell your local copy 
                    where it can find the original. Make your changes to the local version. By running “Git Add” command 
                    followed by the updated file tell Git which files you’ve changed. After that, commit your changes to 
                    the project’s history. Also provide a log message explaining the changes you’ve included in this commit 
                    and push the “Commit” from your local repository to GitHub. There navigate to your copy of the repository 
                    and click the “Pull Request” button. The “Send pull request” button click after you’ve entered a description 
                    of the changes that have been made by you. this process ends when the project’s owner check your changes, 
                    and decide whether they want to include them in their repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As an addition you can also create a branch for your edits, reference any relevant issues or supporting 
                    documentation in your PR, include screenshots of the before and after, and run your changes against any 
                    existing tests or create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t 
                    break the existing project.

                        normal university course. The course begins with a kickoff event in which all parties come together for an intensive 
                        weekend of learning and hacking. After the kickoff, students return to their home universities and continue work in virtual

                        Open Source Lab; other universities may have similar clubs to help you get involved with open source. Some universities
